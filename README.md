## Distributed algorithm

- A distributed algorithm is an algorithm, run on a distributed system, that does not assume the previous existence of a central coordinator.

### Election algorithms

- An election algorithm is an algorithm for solving the coordinator election problem. By the nature of the coordinator election problem, any election algorithm must be a distributed algorithm.
-a group of processes on different machines need to choose a coordinator
